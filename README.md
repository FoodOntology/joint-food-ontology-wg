# joint-food-ontology-wg
This is a repository for documents and issues related to the development of interoperable food related ontologies.  Currently curators from FoodOn, the Food Biomarker Ontology (FOBI), the Ontology for Nutritional Studies (ONS), Medical Action Ontology (MAxO) and the Environmental Conditions, and the Treatments and Exposures ontology (ECTO) are involved.

List the name, URL and scope description of your food related ontology here. 

## FOBI: Food-Biomarker Ontology

## ONS: Ontology for Nutritional Studies

## FIDEO: Food Interactions with Drugs Evidence Ontology

## [FoodOn](https://foodon.org): Food ontology
FoodOn, launched in 2018, is a recently developed ontology that aims to describe food known in cultures throughout the world for human, domestic and agricultural animal consumption. FoodOn is based on the LanguaL™ Food Description Thesaurus, originating in the late 1970s as the “Factored Food Vocabulary” by the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) of the United States Food and Drug Administration, and later adopted by the European LanguaL™ Technical Committee which supports EuroFIR partner national food nutrition databases. All of LanguaL™’s 14 facets of food description have been transformed and mapped into FoodOn ontology branches of vocabulary.

FoodOn is a member of the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry (OBOFoundry), and consequently reuses many CHEBI chemical terms, UBERON and PO anatomy terms, and dataset description elements are being reused from the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) and the Information Architecture Ontology (IAO).
